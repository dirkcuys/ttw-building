		<h2>What's this all about?</h2>
			<p>Spreading digital skills and openness doesn't have to be difficult, but it can be intimidating if you are new to open online communities. <strong>Mozilla is committed to helping you learn about openness while leveling up your own professional practice.</strong></p>

			<p><strong>Everything here is 100% free, open and powered by a community of educators and mentors.</strong> If you get stuck or need help, please reach out to us using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#teachtheweb</a> on Twitter or in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106022863174952221205/stream/4723a453-f65d-49c4-a44e-cae2b9dbada1">Teach the Web G+ Community</a>.</p>

<h2>We want to help you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>connect with other mentors and educators (especially those in your local area) to share knowledge and resources.</li>
<li>use open, participatory practices to teach web skills and bring creativity and digital literacy into your practice.</li>
<li>plug into a global movement that believes in openness, sharing and peer to peer learning.</li>
</ul>
			
			So, welcome to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#teachtheweb</a>. We’re glad you’re here. If you’re new to the Mozilla Webmaker community, here is sample of what’s in store:</p>

			<h2>What’s <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#teachtheweb</a>?</h2>
			
			<p>A nifty blended-learning initiative by <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, peer-powered by <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>. This course is free and open and will be repeating periodically. Read about the very first <a href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/">#teachtheweb here</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>What will I do here?</h2>
			
			<p>We’re here to help you integrate digital making and web skills into your teaching practice with collaborative, peer-to-peer methodologies. You’ll be learning the community-driven pedagogies behind Webmaker by building things yourself, sharing them with others, and starting to teach the world the web.</p>
			
			<p>Each Module will have 3 parts: you’ll explore, make and reflect--and do so in community.</p>

			<h2>Who else is here?</h2>
			
			<p>If you’re an educator--in school, in your library, in an afterschool program--, if you're a technologist who cares about advancing digital literacy, if you want to participate in an open community, <strong>welcome home</strong>. You’re among other passionate folks who do the same stuff and are here to help.</p>
			
			<h2>How do I participate?</h2>
			
			<p>Participating is learning. How much you dig in is entirely up to you. You’ll get something out of it every step of the way. A few general ideas:
			<ul>

			<li>Find your crew. Look at the intros and makes and follow 2-3 people who sound interesting to you during the course.</li>
			<li>Tag your posts <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=teachtheweb&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">#teachtheweb</a> on Twitter.</li>
