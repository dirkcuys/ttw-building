# Host a training

We've developed several Teaching Kits to help you explore the themes we cover in Webmaker Training in a live event. Collectively, these kits make up the bulk of our live Train the Trainer programming. Get a group of interested people together and run a workshop where you can all learn and practice open and participatory learning together!
