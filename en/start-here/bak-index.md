# What's this all about?

We want a web that is open, accessible and ours. In order to achieve that, more of us need to understand its basic mechanics, its culture and what it means to be a citizen of the web. Webmaker Training is part of Mozilla's commitment to help educators and others teach vital web literacy skills. 

Everything here is 100% free, open source and powered by a global community of people like you who want to teach digital and web skills in ways that are creative, participatory and fun. 

# Webmaker Training will help you:
* Integrate the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web into your practice.</li>
* Bring creativity to your teaching through open, participatory methods.</li>
* Connect with fellow mentors and educators (especially those in your local area) to share knowledge and resources. </li>
