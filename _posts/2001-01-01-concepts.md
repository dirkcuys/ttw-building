#Building on the Web

This week, we'll start a conversation around three of the practices we use in the open community to create learning resources that help you empower and inform learners. Our aim is to continue strengthening this community, sharing experiences and make some hackable, shareable resources that push the boundaries of participatory, collaborative, learner-centric learning. You can use the included links to go deeper into each of these topics.

## The Web is for *Making* (not just Consuming)

When we think of the Web, we tend to think of it as a technical infrastructure and a series of services that allow us to connect with one another and share digital artifacts. Many of us don't often consider the immensity of the true fact of what the Web is:

**The Web is human knowledge documented.**

A very, very large amount of human knowledge. It's not new for human beings to document what we know. We've been doing it since the invention of [tokens at the origin of writing][7]. What is new is the way we need to interact with people and systems to make use of that knowledge. What's new are the types of skills and competencies we need to be able to understand information and each other through these machines. **We have to have certain skills to make sense of it all.**

The [Web Literacy Map][8] is a tool that can help you develop these competentcies in learners and nurture participatory learning. We started with the question: **What are the skills, competencies and literacies necessary to read, write and participate on the Web - now and in the future?**

*The Web Literacy Map is a guide to support new pathways, and of course, to find ways for us all to track our impact. That's where the map comes in - we can build consensus around the overall learning objectives and then each chart our course against it.*

It's important to remember that many people are working within systems that make us feel like hacking is not allowed or impossible. Many of us feel that we have to adhere to this or that policy. The question is: Is it our own misconception that makes us feel that way? Does the policy really spell out the way that we are allowed to teach? And even if it does, how can we walk the line?

[In this excellent article][9], [Bud Hunt][10] talks about the agency that we have in teaching and learning. When we're thinking about adding digital and web literacies into our practice, we should remember that we are in control of our own experiences.

To recap:

* The Web is a massive, shifting repository of human knowledge.
* We should empower learners to engage this ecosystem *and* make the Web they want to use.
* Mozilla developed the Web Literacy Map to help educators do just that. 
* We invite you to hack the [Web Literacy Map](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap).


## Roadblocks and Ethics


So the Web is totally important, we want learners to participate in an ethical way--we're probably all on the same page. But, as we're sure you know, **there are several specific issues** that affect our ability to bring webmaking into both formal and informal learning spaces: access, privacy and security. 

![Internet Users by Country World Map from the Wikimedia Commons][11]

For one, there are **definite hardware and network issues**. Some of our learning institutions lack the technical infrastructure to supply learning programs with the high speed internet that is becoming invaluable to webmaking. Others have **strong filters** and monitoring systems that make it hard to allow interest-driven projects. There are marginalized communities with **little or no access to hardware**.

As we think about how we might best [#teachtheweb][12], we should make commitments not only to the mashing up of hard and soft skills, but also to the proliferation of access in our communities. Until there is equal access, we need to find ways to teach [web literacy skills][13] no matter the technical infrastructure we're tied to.

![Mozilla was named the Most Trusted Internet Company for Privacy in 2012, according to a study performed by the Ponemon Institute.][14]

We can (and should) help people understand the basics of **cyber security**. Even simple settings can greatly decrease the risk of an attack and protect you and your data. We can empower our learners by **helping them create secure passwords, know when a website is secure and turn on firewalls and proxies.**

Finally, we need to be aware of how our online movements are documented, how our data is being used, and what we can do to protect ourselves. [Lightbeam][15], an easy-to-use tool that can help us understand tracking, explains that:

*“Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience. But most tracking happens without users' consent and without their knowledge. That’s not okay. It should be you who decides when, how and if you want to be tracked.”* http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/

To recap:

* Ask learners to think through how they feel about access, privacy and security as part of their Web Literacy.
* In spreading knowledge, your efforts with #teachtheweb also help solve the access roadblock on a wider scale. Good stuff :)

## The Role of the Educator

Some folks think that, as digital learning rises, [we won't need teachers anymore][16] (this isn't the first time someone has said this). This is completely ridiculous of course, but brings up some interesting thoughts on our roles as educators.

Just as the influx of digital technologies has begun to redefine what it means to be "educated" so too has this influx redefined what it means to be an "educator." Today, **learning happens everywhere, and there are teachers everywhere.** Some of them identify as “educators” or “teachers”, while others identify as “technologists” or “instructors”. Some of them have regular classes while others are known around the office as someone who “can fix your computer”. **What all of these people have in common is that they are mentoring learners.** They might be doing it in different ways – some of them mentor professionally, others aren't even aware of their impact – but technology is pervasive enough that anyone with the applicable skills is trying to pull others along.

As we advance our practice and try to find ways to navigate the waters around technology or around pedagogy, we need to consistently turn our focus inward. **We need to remember those learning experiences that most touched us.** Whether the digital space was involved at all isn't relevant, it's how we interacted with people around us. **What kind of freedoms did we have to play and make mistakes and inspire our peers?** How were we given constraints to guide us towards learning something specific?

In Webmaking, we need to intermingle participation, collaboration and other “soft” skills with technical “hard” skills whenever we can. **Web literacy is not just about coding, and webmaking is not just about digital storytelling.** Through interest-driven “make” projects that offer the learner a safe space to explore, we can motivate and inspire our learners to be responsible citizens in both the digital and physical world.

To recap:

* In each learning experience, think about the moments that inspired you to make the web. Tap those experiences of play, passion and peers to help others in the experiences you create.


## Peers Working in the Open

## Building Together: The Design Process

"Design thinking" is the practice of solving problems for humans, with other humans. Instead of working with hypothetical arguments or problem sets, learners engage real-world problems and work together on proposed solutions (education folks might also use the terms [authentic assessments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_assessment) or [experiential learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning) to describe these kinds of assignments. 

In "Design Challenges" learners select a problem, conduct research with users, prototype a solution, give and receive feedback, and iterate to produce a final project.

[IDEO](http://www.ideo.com/), the innovative design agency, has created a [Design Toolkit](http://www.designthinkingforeducators.com/design-examples/) for Educators which helps teachers co-design solutions with students:

![screen shot 2014-03-29 at 10 51 52 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1874003/2558623/be66bfb4-b751-11e3-8523-a249f0de7d2e.png)

For instance, "Design Thinking Hawaii" collaborated with students at Castle Hill High School in Hawaii to redesign and restructure the high school to solve issues with engagement and learning outcomes.

>Through a series of mini-charettes, Design Thinking Hawaii has collected the needs and interests of learners, teachers, and families and engaged the larger community to imagine new solutions that could help the school be more effective. The adopted plan captured the community’s priorities in new content and structures, and Complex Area Superintendent Lea Albert is enabling the school and community to prototype and iterate core curriculum, character education, and support services.

Through the design process, students learn from the community around them and work together on a solution that is relevant to their lives. The web is the perfect medium for students to prototype solutions to these real-world problems.

### Constructive Criticism

Feedback is the basis for open source culture. Pull requests, comments, sharing posts--these are all "gestures" of feedback. The conversations are how we build, nurture and maintain our networks. It's the glue of the Web. 

When feedback is positive, we gather strength and confidence, just as negative feedback forces us to consider whether our ideas are valid. In learning to participate on the Web, we learn how to accept and deliver feedback to improve our ideas and contribute to our communities. So how do we learn to give and receive feedback? We design for the feedback to be *constructive*. Now what does that mean? It's tricky. 

Let's focus on delivering feedback first. 

*Giving constructive criticism (and receiving it) is something that takes practice.* We adhere to [“if you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumper_%28Bambi%29) because we don't believe that our opinions are necessary. We forget that criticism doesn't have to lead to complete redesign or reformulation. 

*We also tend to spend time focusing on our own things, rather than looking at other people's ideas and thinking about making them better. We ask for feedback and expect to get some, but we rarely give our feedback freely – we wait until our specific feedback is requested or until the work directly affects our own.*

We all know how fantastic it is to get good, constructive feedback on something we're working on. What if we all took more time to give feedback like that to others? What would happen? 

Now to what it feels like to receive feedback.

*It can be hard to hear critiques that reshape your work, but think about the input with some distance and consider how it might improve what you're doing.* If, in the end, you disagree with the critique, explain why and your reaction will lead to a further conversation. We should aim to assume good faith when discussing feedback, and think not only of what to critique, but also concrete proposals to make it better.
*Feedback is a way to invite people into your project. Asking for it can become a gateway to deeper participation and collaboration as it gives agency.*

In our experience as online educators, we find that asking learners to produce drafts and iterate upon them, sharing in an open "studio"-type space, and asking learners to remix each other's work are all ways to build a culture of feedback. 

### Deeper Collaboration

As evidenced by its very name, the "Web" is not built by one person--the Web is, by its nature, collaborative. Just as learning to give and receive feedback takes practice, so does collaboration. Not everyone learns the same way. *People learn to collaborate in different ways, along multiple paths, just as they learn to code or make things.* Our experiences in group work past and present have great influence over how we think about ourselves as collaborators, and how we act as collaborators is greatly contingent on who we are.

As we discussed earlier, our roles as mentors are changing, and so are the roles of learners and peers. *These roles are fluid in maker and remix pedagogies, and they're fluid in spaces where community and inquiry drive co-learning and making.* 

Building a culture of feedback is one way to invite deeper collaboration. Another is group work where you might invite folks to learn from each other. Each of us has something to offer and give, and when we collaborate we build empathy. We understand the different contexts and opinions of the people we work with. When we nuture empahty, we build a better, kinder Web.

In short, the power of the open Web comes from our ability to share. **In the learning experiences we design, when we create spaces to share our work with each other, we model the way the Web works.** These complex social spaces encourage freedom of expression and honesty.

To recap:

* Feedback is the glue of the Web. First, focus on how to deliver the constructive feedback as a way to contribute. Receiving constructive feedback can hurt, but it gets easier as you share.
* Collaboration builds empathy. Empathy builds a kinder Web. As educators, we're used to standing up in front of the room sharing our expertise. When we design for group work and collaboration, we model how the web works.
